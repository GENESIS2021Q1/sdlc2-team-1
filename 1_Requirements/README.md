# Requirements

## Introduction
To design a system which calculates various electrical and electronics parameter for the user's ease.

## Research
•	The conductor cross-section shall be chosen such that the conductor withstands prospective short circuit current for a specified duration of time.

•	Area of cross-section of the conductor shall be sized to carry estimated load current continuously such that the temperature rise of the conductor is within the acceptable limits for the installation conditions foreseen

•	Voltage drop within the cable is within the permissible limits so that the functionality of the connected load by the cable remains unaffected

## Cost and Features

• The advantage of this project the the quickness in which the program works and no need to perform heavy calculation which will be taken care by the program

• A lot of time and money can be saved in this project as the result leads to quick installation and accurate results.

## Defining MY System
   
• The system will be getting some essential paramenters from the user and it will compute the values and with which it will be able to choose or design the product.
